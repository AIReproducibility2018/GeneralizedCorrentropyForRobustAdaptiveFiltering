# GeneralizedCorrentropyForRobustAdaptiveFiltering

This is a reimplementation of the Generalized Maximum Correntropy Criterion (GMCC) algorithm from the article "Generalized Correntropy for Robust Adaptive Filtering" (https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2539127). It was created with the purpose of reproducing the results reported in the paper. Two of the simulations from the article were attempted: 
	- "Probability of Divergence" 
	- "Performance Comparison With Other Algorithms" The results in Figure 4 were attempted reproduced.

The "Code" folder contains the code produced during the reproduction attempt.

The "Results" folder contains the results from re-running the experiments.
