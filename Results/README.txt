This folder contains the reuslts from the two simulations ran, found in each respective folder. The result from each run is shown in two formats. A .png file shows the graph, and a .json_lines file contains the full results.


The format of the .json_lines is a little different in the two simulations:

"Probability of Divergence" 
	data
		Hyperparameters
			Mu
			Lambda
			Alfa
		Runs
			POD
			Weights
		
	
"Performance Comparison With Other Algorithms"
	data
		Hyperparameters
			Mu
			Lambda
			Alfa
		Weight Error Power Values
